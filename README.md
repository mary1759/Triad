## Inspiration
The challenge given by Tailwind was to create an application that caters small business owners including solopreneurs and entrepreneurs. And we did exactly that to help these retailers get to their potential customers even before the customer knows what he wants through targeted ads! 

## What it does
It predicts the customers' needs(product or service they will go for) based on the information they have provided when they sign up for our application. And this prediction is given to the small business owners.

## How we built it
The classification model was learnt and built using python. The server was also on python using the flask framework and the front end web application was written using HTML and javascript and used axios to communicate with the server. 

## Challenges we ran into
The API side of things were new to us and ran into a lot of hurdles when we wanted to make the three parts of our application talk to each other.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learning and implementing front end development and server hosting in less than 12 hours! 

## What's next for Triad
Including features such as group predictions and a retail perspective to the application for the small business owner to access and maintain. Our main aim is to help the small business owners not only in well-developed cities/countries but also encourage people in developing and underdeveloped countries.
